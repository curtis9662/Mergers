# 🛠️ Platform Engineering Runbook: M&A Employee DevBox Integration

> **Classification:** Enterprise Process | Procedural Planning 
> **Objective:** Deployment of strictly segmented, structurally isolated DevBox compute environments for integrated personnel resulting from corporate mergers, ensuring zero circumvention of cryptographic and access-control security perimeters.
> **Empirical Basis:** Methodologies are strictly derived from computationally validated Azure provisioning protocols. 
> **Primary Citation:** [Microsoft Azure DevBox Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dev-box/)

## 📑 Phase I: Verification of Cryptographic & Software Licensure

Prior to instantiating compute resources, topological validation of user identity and licensing states is computationally requisite. 

| Verification Vector | Requisite Entitlement | Validation Mechanism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity Subsystem** | Microsoft Entra ID P1 (or P2) | Azure Portal > Entra ID > Licenses |
| **Endpoint Management** | Microsoft Intune | Intune Admin Center > Tenant Administration |
| **Operating System** | Windows 11 Enterprise | M365 E3/E5, A3/A5, Windows 365 Enterprise |
| **Compute Topology** | Azure Dev Center & Network Connection | Azure Resource Graph / CLI checks |

## 🏗️ Phase II: Base Computation Template (Image Definition)

A standardized, immutable foundation must be established prior to pool allocation to guarantee zero-drift baseline security.

### Procedural Steps:
1. Navigate to **Dev Center** within the Azure control plane.
2. Select **Dev Box definitions** ➔ **+ Create**.
3. **Configure Parameters:**
   * **Image Selection:** Select the hardened corporate baseline (e.g., Windows 11 Enterprise + M365 Apps) from the Azure Compute Gallery.
   * **Compute Dimensions:** Select rigorous hardware specifications (e.g., 8 vCPU, 32GB RAM).
   * **Storage Allocation:** Provision SSD capacity (e.g., 512 GB) validated against M&A developer workload requirements.
4. Execute deployment and await validation signals confirming definition readiness.

## 🌊 Phase III: Project Pool Instantiation & Access Provisioning

The Pool governs the spatial grouping and regional instantiation of the defined compute resources.

### Procedural Steps:
1. Navigate to the designated **Project** mapped to the M&A integration unit.
2. Select **Dev Box pools** ➔ **+ Create**.
3. **Bind Dependencies:**
   * Link to the **Dev Box definition** established in Phase II.
   * Attach the highly segmented **Network Connection** governing the isolated VNet.
   * Enable **Local Administrator** privileges (if mathematically required by the developer persona) or restrict strictly to Standard User.
   * Configure **Auto-Stop** schedules to terminate rogue consumption.
4. **Access Delegation:**
   * Navigate to **Access control (IAM)** within the Project space.
   * Assign the Role: `Dev Box User`.
   * Bind to the Target Security Group containing the newly integrated M&A personnel.

## 📬 Phase IV: Access Protocol Communication

The following syntax is structurally optimized for unambiguous end-user execution.

**Subject:** 💻 [Action Required] Accessing Your Secure Corporate Development Environment

**Body:**

> Welcome. To access your logically isolated development environment, execute the following parameters:
> 
> **Prerequisite:** Ensure your organizational identity is active. 
> **Username:** `<name.user@org.tld>`
> 
> **Execution Steps:**
> 1. Authenticate via secure portal: [https://devbox.microsoft.com](https://devbox.microsoft.com) 
> 2. Input your organizational credentials and fulfill Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) requirements.
> 3. Locate your assigned workstation pool and select **"+ Add Dev Box"**.
> 4. Once provisioning concludes, select **"Open in RDP Client"** or **"Open in Browser"** to establish the compute session.
> 
> *Note: This environment operates under strict security segmentation policies. Do not attempt to bypass endpoint telemetry.*
