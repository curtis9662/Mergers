Subject: Urgent: Process Deviation and Strategic Friction in Endpoint Management

Team,
I am writing to address a significant deviation from our operational governance regarding the recent endpoint updates. It has come to my attention that these updates were implemented without prior consultation with Engineering and, critically, without an approved Change Control artifact.
This is not merely a procedural oversight; it represents a form of "Strategic Friction" that directly undermines our organizational velocity.
When execution arms bypass the checks and balances established by Engineering, we introduce unnecessary volatility into the environment. By circumventing the Change Control Board (CCB) and failing to engage technical stakeholders, we create two immediate risks:
Operational Instability: We are introducing unvetted variables into our ecosystem, heightening the risk of outage or degradation without a prepared rollback plan.
Resource Misalignment: Engineering resources are forced to pivot from roadmap initiatives to reactive triage, investigating changes they were not aware of.

Immediate Requirements:

Cease Unilateral Updates: All non-emergency endpoint modifications must pause until they are routed through the standard Change Management process.

Retroactive Review: A Change Control request must be filed retroactively for the recent updates so Engineering can properly assess impact and record the change for audit purposes.

Process Re-alignment: We need to ensure that the deployment teams understand that Engineering consultation is a mandatory step, not an optional courtesy.

We cannot afford to work at cross-purposes. Our governance exists to enable speed through stability, not to hinder progress. I expect full adherence to these protocols effective immediately to eliminate this friction.

Regards,
